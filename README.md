# DSCaseStudy2-Credit-Fraud README
    Group Project (Team 2) for Vanderbilt DSI Course 5360: Case Studies in Data Science. This is Case Study #2, Detecting Credit Card Fraud

    Original Project Link: https://data-flair.training/blogs/data-science-machine-learning-project-credit-card-fraud-detection/

## This Repo is organized in the following manner: 
    1. Data - This contains the link of Credit Fraud dataset which is used to train our machine learning models.
    2. ipynb files - Run these files to present the model performance in each ML model after training Credit Fraud dataset.
    3. HTML files - Basic statistical analysis reports for the entire dataset and only the fraud data.

## ipynb file description
        In order to run the notebook file below, you might need to download the dataset and save it under corresponding address.

    1.XGBoost_and_GDB_Model.ipynb
        We scale time and amout to improve convergence speed of the model and also enhance model accuracy. Then we compare XGB and GBD model performance. After choosing XGB model, we use two different sampling methods techique on XGB models. Finally, we use cross validation method to turn the parameter for XGB and show our final results of XGB model.

    2. RF_credit card.ipynb
    
       Random Forest model pipeline with three different sampling methods.
   
    3. RF_test_db_for_dashboard.ipynb   
    
       Generating test data with preditc probability for Random Forest which will be used for the dashboard.
